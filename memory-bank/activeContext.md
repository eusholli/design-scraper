# Active Context: Web Page Design Scheme Extractor (Implementation Complete)

## Current Focus

The initial implementation of the `design_scheme_extractor.py` script is complete, based on the detailed plan in `implementation.md`. All specified functions, including core extraction logic, schema generation/validation, helper functions, the plugin system, and output generators (AI optimization, code snippets, documentation), have been added to the script. The command-line interface is also implemented.

## Recent Changes

-   Created `requirements.txt` with all dependencies.
-   Installed dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
-   Created `design_scheme_extractor.py`.
-   Implemented all functions from `implementation.md` into `design_scheme_extractor.py`.
-   Updated `progress.md` to reflect the completion of the initial implementation phase.
-   Updated this file (`activeContext.md`).

## Next Steps

-   **Testing:** Run the script against various URLs to test its functionality, robustness, and accuracy.
-   **Refinement:** Based on testing, refine the extraction logic (e.g., selectors, heuristics, error handling).
-   **Documentation Review:** Ensure the generated Markdown documentation is clear and accurate.
-   **Code Review:** Review the implemented code for clarity, efficiency, and adherence to best practices.

## Key Considerations & Patterns (Implemented)

-   **Robustness:** Hybrid fetching (`requests`/`selenium`), multi-method analysis (colors), computed style reliance, safe script execution wrapper implemented.
-   **Modularity:** Code structured into distinct functions for each step.
-   **Extensibility:** Basic plugin system with a WordPress example implemented.
-   **AI-Friendliness:** `optimize_for_ai_consumption` function implemented.
-   **Developer Aids:** Functions for generating code snippets (`generate_design_code_snippets`) and documentation (`generate_documentation`) implemented.
-   **Error Handling:** Basic error handling (`try...except`) included in most functions and the main orchestration logic, including `finally` block for driver cleanup.
-   **Dependency Management:** Using `requirements.txt`.
