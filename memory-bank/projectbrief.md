# Project Brief: Web Page Design Scheme Extractor

## Overview

This program aims to extract the visual design scheme from a given web page URL. It will analyze elements such as colors, typography, spacing, and visual patterns identified on the page.

## Goal

The primary goal is to produce a structured output format (JSON) detailing the extracted design scheme. This output should be suitable for consumption by AI systems to enable the generation of visually consistent graphics based on the analyzed website's brand identity.

## Core Functionality

- Fetch and render web pages (handling both static and dynamic content).
- Extract color palettes (dominant, CSS-defined, computed).
- Analyze typography (headings, body text, font imports).
- Assess layout and spacing characteristics (page dimensions, container width, common spacing units).
- Detect common UI component styles (buttons, cards, forms, navigation).
- Analyze image and icon usage patterns (SVG, icon fonts, image styling, logo detection).
- Generate a comprehensive, validated JSON schema representing the design.
- Provide additional outputs like AI-optimized schemas, code snippets (CSS variables, Tailwind config, Styled Components), and Markdown documentation.
