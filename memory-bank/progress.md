# Progress: Web Page Design Scheme Extractor

## Current Status (Implementation Complete - 2025-04-06)

-   **Project Phase:** Initial Implementation Complete.
-   **Memory Bank:** Core documentation files are up-to-date with the initial plan.
-   **Code Implementation:** The Python script `design_scheme_extractor.py` has been created and populated with all functions outlined in `implementation.md`.
-   **Dependencies:** `requirements.txt` created and dependencies installed.

## What Works

-   The script `design_scheme_extractor.py` is structurally complete based on the plan.
-   It includes functions for fetching, analysis, schema generation, validation, plugin handling, AI optimization, code snippet generation, documentation generation, and a CLI.
-   It can be executed via the command line.

## What's Left to Build

-   Testing and validation with various websites.
-   Refinement of extraction logic based on testing results (e.g., improving color/component detection accuracy).
-   Potential addition of more plugins for different website types.
-   Addressing potential performance bottlenecks identified during testing.
-   Implementing potential improvements mentioned in `implementation.md` (caching, custom color names, etc.).

## Known Issues

-   The script has not yet been tested against real-world websites. Its robustness and accuracy are unverified.
-   The `time.sleep(5)` in `fetch_webpage` is a basic wait and might not be sufficient for all dynamic pages. More sophisticated waiting strategies (e.g., waiting for specific elements) might be needed.
-   Color/component/layout analysis relies on heuristics and sampling, which might not be accurate for all website structures.

## Decisions & Evolution

-   The project structure and implementation plan were derived directly from the provided `implementation.md` file.
-   Added `requirements.txt` for dependency management as requested.
-   Implemented all core functions and optional output generators as planned.
